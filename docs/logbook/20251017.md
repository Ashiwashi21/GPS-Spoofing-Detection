October 17th 2025 (Ashirvad):
- Made part of the sensor.py file to collect gps data
- Oh no! The imu module had to be soldered, so we returned it and bought a presoldered device. This is the reason why the project is slightly delayed. It will be coming tomorrow
- Logged 30 minutes of raw GPS data
- Visualized all data for the gps module using pandas and folium
- I might need to clean up my workspace and work with a virtual environment to make sure no issues happen, and I have to push updates to the github repo more oftens
