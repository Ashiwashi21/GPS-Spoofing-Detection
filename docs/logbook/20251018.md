October 18th 2025 (Ashirvad):
- Received IMU module for usage
- Connected MPU6050 to raspberry pi and enabled I2C using sudo raspi-config
- Tested the MPU6050 by running imu.py to read accelerometer, gyroscope, and temperature data (had to troubleshoot it since it didn't work in the virtual environment)
- Added 30 minutes of IMU data to a csv for logging
